# Say Hi to

This is just a demo package to practice the knowledge of publishing a personal npm package.

### It does:

print out the parameter that you enter in the function name.

### Example:

```js
const greeting = require('say-hi-to');
const jianglin = 'JiangLin';
const result = greeting(jianglin);


console.log(result);
```


Ps, I followed this tutorial:
[Tutorial](https://dev.to/therealdanvega/creating-your-first-npm-package-2ehf)

Later I might update this with my personal experience of how to do it...

But it will be basically the same thing...

So, I might not do it😅😝
